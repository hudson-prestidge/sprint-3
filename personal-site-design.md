What is your site's primary purpose?

To record my reflections on the process of learning to become a web developer.

Who is your target audience?

Anyone else who is currently learning or considering learning to become a web developer.

How do you want visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?

I'd like them to be able to learn from my experiences, my mistakes and my suggestions to help them with their own process.

How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?

Besides expressing what I have learned and reflecting on that in the blog posts, I will ty to include what I considered to be particularly useful information; links to useful sources, good ways of summarising an idea and to try to draw focus to this pertinent information.
